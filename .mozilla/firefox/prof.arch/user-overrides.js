/* 4504: enable RFP letterboxing [FF67+]
 * Dynamically resizes the inner window by applying margins in stepped ranges [2]
 * If you use the dimension pref, then it will only apply those resolutions.
 * The format is "width1xheight1, width2xheight2, ..." (e.g. "800x600, 1000x1000")
 * [SETUP-WEB] This is independent of RFP (4501). If you're not using RFP, or you are but
 * dislike the margins, then flip this pref, keeping in mind that it is effectively fingerprintable
 * [WARNING] DO NOT USE: the dimension pref is only meant for testing

 * RFP also has a few side effects: mainly timezone is UTC0, and websites will prefer light theme
